# UTRA Hacks 2025

**Background**  
Over the last century, robotics has made huge strides by excelling in controlled environments such as factory floors. However, today’s world demands more dynamic and adaptive machines that can operate amid uncertainty—varying surfaces, shifting obstacles, and unexpected interactions with other moving objects. Robots must now detect, decide, and act on the fly in ever-changing conditions to tackle real-world challenges.

**Challenge Overview**  
In this year’s closed challenge, using their Arduino-based kits and only the supplemental materials provided in the hardware kit. Teams must design a robot to interpret colour-coded floor markers and use its sensors to accomplish three challenging courses.
